### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Optional Enhancements)
- **Data Export/Import**: JSON export for backup and data portability
- **Event Categories**: Color-coded event types and filtering
- **Search Functionality**: Find events by title or date range
- **Recurring Events**: Basic repeat options (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **Event Reminders**: Browser notifications (if supported)
- **Advanced UI**: Drag-and-drop event scheduling between dates

## Logical Dependency Chain

### Foundation First (Must Build in This Order)
1. **Calendar Math**: Date utilities for month calculations and day-of-week logic
2. **HTML Structure**: Semantic calendar grid with proper accessibility
3. **CSS Grid Layout**: Responsive 7-column calendar grid
4. **Month Navigation**: Previous/next month with proper date calculations
5. **Date Click Events**: Event handlers for calendar date interactions

### Core Interactive Features
6. **Event Data Model**: JavaScript classes/objects for event storage
7. **LocalStorage Layer**: Persistent data save/load functionality
8. **Event Creation Modal**: Form popup triggered by date clicks
9. **Event Display**: Visual indicators showing events on calendar dates
10. **Event Editing**: Click-to-edit functionality with pre-populated forms

### Polish & Optimization
11. **Responsive CSS**: Mobile-first design with media queries
12. **Event Deletion**: Safe delete with confirmation dialogs
13. **Form Validation**: Input checking and error message display
14. **Performance**: Efficient DOM updates and event rendering

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Challenges
- Date/time calculations across time zones → Use native Date API carefully
- Browser compatibility → Target modern browsers, provide fallbacks
- Performance with many events → Implement efficient rendering strategies

### MVP Scope Management
- Start with essential features only
- Focus on monthly view first
- Defer advanced features to later phases
- Ensure each phase delivers working functionality

### Resource Constraints
- Keep dependencies minimal (vanilla JS approach)
- Modular architecture for incremental development
- Clear separation of concerns for maintainability
